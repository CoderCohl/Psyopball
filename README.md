Psyopball is a continuous distribution mechanism built around actual on-chain behavior, not slogans.

Every cycle, the system evaluates current holders and filters for wallets holding at least a minimum threshold of tokens. From that eligible set, a fixed number of wallets are randomly selected and receive equal distributions. This process runs automatically at fixed intervals.

There is no staking, no snapshots, no claim windows, and no manual selection. Eligibility is live and based only on balance at the time of execution. Selection is stateless, meaning previous rewards do not affect future selection. Each interval stands on its own.

The goal is to convert ongoing system activity into consistent token flow back to holders without encouraging timing games or passive farming. Participation requires maintaining exposure, not clicking buttons or watching blocks.

Psyopball is designed to be simple, transparent, and repeatable. It is not a promise of yield. It is a distribution rule set that anyone can verify and reason about.
